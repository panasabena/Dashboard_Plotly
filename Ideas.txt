Here are the ideas for interactive dashboards in English:

1. Real-time Billing Dashboard: This dashboard could display key data such as volume of calls, messages and data per second, along with corresponding rates. It could also include a historical view to compare current performance with previous periods.

2. VIP Customer Dashboard: This dashboard could provide detailed information about your most important customers, including real-time usage of services, paid rates, and outstanding bills. It could also include charts showing historical usage for identifying trends and usage patterns.

3. Departmental Billing Dashboard: This dashboard could display the amount billed, volume of traffic, and other key metrics by department or group. This could help identify areas where resource optimization can improve financial benefits.

4. Product-specific Billing Dashboard: This dashboard could display the amount billed, volume of traffic, and other key metrics by product or service offered. It could help identify highly profitable products and those that may need rate or sales strategy review.

5. Complaints & Resolutions Dashboard: This dashboard could display the number of complaints received, time to resolution, and other key metrics. It could help identify recurring problems and improve customer service efficiency.

6. Automated Reporting Dashboard: This dashboard could display weekly or monthly automatically generated reports on outstanding bills, paid rates, and other key metrics. It could simplify daily work in the Billing Operations department.

7. Customer Analysis Dashboard: This dashboard could provide detailed information about your customers, including historical usage of services, paid rates, and outstanding bills. It could also include charts showing usage patterns and trends to identify opportunities for additional sales and customer retention.

8. Network Analysis Dashboard: This dashboard could display key data on the performance of the telecommunications network, such as volume of traffic, connection speeds, latency, and other metrics. It could help identify areas where resource optimization can improve service quality and reduce operational costs.

9. Operational Analysis Dashboard: This dashboard could provide key data on billing operations, including bill processing efficiency, time to resolve problems, and other metrics. It could help identify areas where resource optimization can improve daily work in the Billing Operations department.

*"First of all, this is a test dashboard built with synthetic data. 
The goal of this prototype is to show how visualizations could support day-to-day decision-making and provide leaders with an at-a-glance view of key billing operations.
While exploring ideas, I identified potential dashboards that could bring value, such as:
* Real-time billing tracking
* VIP customer monitoring
* Department billing performance
* Product billing performance
* Complaints and resolution follow-up
* Customer behavior analysis
* Network and operations analysis

These datasets could be updated automatically (daily, weekly, or customized), and we could also set up automated email reports tailored to each leader’s preferences.
This dashboard was developed in Python, but it can also be built in other tools such as Power BI, Tableau, or MicroStrategy ···········— all of which I have experience with. 
Of course, the choice would depend on which licenses Charter currently has active. If no licenses are available, the only requirement would be having Python installed in the VDI, as we can leverage open-source libraries.

As for deployment into production, that would require defining the right environment for hosting and sharing these dashboards with stakeholders.


This presentation is just a starting point — a way to visualize how data-driven reporting could make our operations more efficient and insightful.
